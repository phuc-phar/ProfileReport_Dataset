# ProfileReport_Dataset
This repository I would like to update the python library Pandas-profiling, from April - 2024 it was changed to ydata-profiling!
## About
Pandas-profiling is a useful tool for doing basic EDA. It helps you create an html page that can be stored and transmitted quickly. Pandas-profiling helps you get a comprehensive view of the data set, the distribution of each column as well as the correlation between columns. Using this tool will help you greatly reduce your EDA time.
But from 1st April 2024, it was changed to ydata-profling. 
## Install the Package
pip install ydata-profiling
## use in python script
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport
